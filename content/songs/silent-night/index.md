This is my composition of Silent Night. Included is a MIDI file, a PDF sheet music and the original Lilypond file used to create this composition.

* [Silent Night MIDI](%assets_url%/silent-night-one-verse.mid)
* [Silent Night Sheet Music PDF](%assets_url%/silent-night-one-verse.pdf)
* [Silent Night Lilypond File](%assets_url%/silent-night-one-verse.ly)

I started this composition in 2020, but didn't finish until 2022. It's not perfect, but it gets the job done.

## TODO
* Expand composition to include all three verses
* Add solo section
* Add a wind section - flute
* Include piano embellishments
