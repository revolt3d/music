I obviously didn't right this melody. I made this MIDI version of Georgia on my Mind when I was studying great melodies. This melody qualifies as a great.

Written in 1930 by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell. Carmichael first recorded Georgia on my Mind, but it would be Ray Charles who made the song famous in 1960.

I think this composition I've put together is an accurate representation of this famous melody. I made these files in October 2020.
