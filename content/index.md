This is my Music Magazine. 

It's a bunch of random bits of information about music that I've acquired over the last 4 decades of studying music. I'm not a typical musician, so most of this is probably not interesting to anyone but myself. 

If you find this information useful, that's great, if not, that's OK too. This magazine is largely made for one reader - myself. If I don't document this stuff, I'll forget that it exists.

## Songs
This is a list of songs I've either made for an original compositions and other "cover" songs.

* [Silent Night](songs/silent-night)
* [Georgia on my Mind Melody](songs/georgia-on-my-mind)

## Technique

* [Ableton Live 10 - Record with an analog synth using MIDI](technique/ableton-live-record-midi-analog-synth)
